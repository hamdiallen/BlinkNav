# BlinkNav
 BlinkNav – Head and Eye Controlled Mouse System  BlinkNav is an assistive technology project that enables full mouse control using only head movements and eye blinks. Designed primarily for individuals with limited hand mobility, it uses a standard webcam and real-time face tracking to emulate cursor movement and mouse clicks.
🧠 Head-based cursor control: The pointer moves in sync with the user's head movements using facial landmark tracking.

👁️ Blink detection for clicking:

Left eye blink → Left click

Right eye blink → Right click

🛠️ Adjustable sensitivity through GUI

📷 Webcam-only solution, no external hardware required

🧩 Built with Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyQt5
